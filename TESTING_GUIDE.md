# Real-Time Chat App Testing Guide

## 🚀 Current Status
✅ Backend server running on http://localhost:5000
✅ Frontend server running on http://localhost:5173
✅ Database connected and seeded with test users
✅ API endpoints tested and working
✅ Socket.io server configured and ready

## 👥 Test Users Created
- **User 1**: sanuda@example.com / Password123
- **User 2**: sanuda2@example.com / Password123
- **Chat**: Private chat already created between these users

## 🧪 Manual Testing Steps

### Step 1: Prepare Testing Environment
1. Open two browser windows:
   - Window 1: Normal browsing mode
   - Window 2: Incognito/Private mode (to simulate different user sessions)

### Step 2: Login Both Users
1. **Window 1**: Go to http://localhost:5173
   - Click "Login" or navigate to login page
   - Enter: sanuda@example.com / Password123
   - Click Login

2. **Window 2**: Go to http://localhost:5173 (in incognito/private mode)
   - Click "Login" or navigate to login page
   - Enter: sanuda2@example.com / Password123
   - Click Login

### Step 3: Navigate to Chat
1. Both users should see the chat interface
2. Select the chat between sanuda and sanuda2
3. You should see the existing messages from our test setup

### Step 4: Test Real-Time Messaging
1. **In Window 1 (sanuda)**: Type a message and send it
   - Example: "Hello! Testing real-time messaging 👋"
   - Message should appear in Window 2 instantly

2. **In Window 2 (sanuda2)**: Reply with a message
   - Example: "Hi! I can see your message in real-time! 🚀"
   - Message should appear in Window 1 instantly

3. Continue sending messages back and forth to verify real-time functionality

### Step 5: Test Typing Indicators
1. **In Window 1**: Start typing (don't send)
   - Window 2 should show "sanuda is typing..." indicator

2. **In Window 2**: Start typing (don't send)
   - Window 1 should show "sanuda2 is typing..." indicator

3. Stop typing - indicators should disappear

### Step 6: Test Online/Offline Status
1. Check if users show as "online" in the chat interface
2. Close one browser window and check if the other shows user as offline
3. Refresh or reopen to test reconnection

### Step 7: Test Additional Features
1. **Message Status**: Check for delivery/read receipts
2. **Scroll Loading**: Send many messages and test scroll behavior
3. **Image Sharing**: If implemented, test image uploads
4. **Profile Pictures**: Check if default avatars are showing

## 🔍 What to Look For

### ✅ Expected Behaviors
- Messages appear instantly in both windows
- Typing indicators work correctly
- Online/offline status updates
- Chat list updates with latest messages
- Smooth scrolling and message loading
- No console errors in browser DevTools

### ❌ Potential Issues
- Messages not appearing in real-time
- Typing indicators not working
- Socket connection errors (check browser console)
- Authentication issues
- UI layout problems on different screen sizes

## 🛠️ Debugging Tips

### Check Browser Console
1. Open Developer Tools (F12)
2. Check Console tab for errors
3. Look for Socket.io connection logs
4. Check Network tab for failed API requests

### Check Server Logs
1. Monitor the terminal running the backend server
2. Look for socket connection/disconnection logs
3. Check for any error messages

### Common Issues & Solutions
1. **CORS Issues**: Ensure backend CORS is configured for http://localhost:5173
2. **Authentication**: Check if tokens are being stored and sent correctly
3. **Socket Connection**: Verify socket.io client is connecting to correct server URL
